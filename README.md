# Detection of language-persuasive techniques attempts. 

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

An application supporting the detection of language-persuasive techniques attempts. 

## Background

Large enterprises employing entire armies of salespeople can afford to train their employees so they can exert a more effective influence on their customers. I came across this when I was working in the financial industry. However, I'm sure the problem occurs in many fields, especially when sales volume and the commission matter. I myself participated in trainings in NLP techniques (neurolinguistic programming). The explanation, of course, was that we were doing it for the comfort of the customer. And indeed, in a perfect world it would be. However, in the real world, where there is a commission at the end of the sales process, the threat of manipulation becomes real.
I have seen this behavior in the financial industry (I am no longer part of it) and would like to help clients make decisions that are will not influenced by the profit motive of the person sitting on the other side of the desk.
It seems to me important, because it leads to equal opportunities for two sides, one of whom has an advantage when we talk about sales experience.



## How is it used?

After starting the application, it will "listen" to the conversation and search for forms of communication characteristic for the user. At the moment when detecting a manipulation attempt (by using the same patterns of conversaction by the other side), it would inform the user by sending a message. Could use (for example) sms notification sound. The user, of course, does not have to react in any way. It is enough to inform him. Of course, you can adapt it to both face-to-face and telephone conversations.
This problem affects everyone who comes into contact with sellers striving to maximize their profits. It's can sometimes lead consumers to make not the best decisions for themselves.



## Data sources and AI methods
Speech processing techniques will are crucial here. The application would first have to "listen" to the user and match them to predefined communication patterns. In simple terms, they will be: a visual learner, an auditory learner and a kinesthetic learner. This stage of building my AI would require the participation of specialists from other fields (communication, psychology, PR, sales, marketing, etc.). The next step would be to teach the algorithm to "match" the user to a pattern, or rather (in practice) between patterns.
## Challenges

Data security will be a huge challenge. I believe the sellers would like to have this type of information to can  more effectively moderate sales conversations / processes for a specific customer.
Many of the app users may not be aware of these risks and may not understand the importance of feedback initially. So, it would be important to rethink how to show it. It could be some graph showing the match of the interlocutors. I think other informative/educational opportunities may arise over the refining the idea process.
Other limitations will be (so far) the same that are currently known for speech recognition algorithms.

## What next?

That is a very interesting question because (indeed) the issues that I perceive as threats could be areas where the application could develop in future.
1. Comfort of communication - the use of these solutions could actually improve the feeling of the conversation, lead to better understanding, and facilitate the transfer of difficult information.
2. Medical diagnostics - I suppose that during consultations with specialists in various fields (psychologists, psychiatrists, doctors), one could find patterns of statements indicating potential threats of diseases.

However, the above-mentioned areas of potential development are also areas of ethical threats. They are sensitive issues and would need to be carefully considered.
